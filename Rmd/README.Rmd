# DAL Toolbox DP Examples

This directory groups examples by topic. Each item links to the subfolder’s `README.md`, which lists the contained examples with short descriptions.

- [autoencoder](autoencoder/README.md) — Autoencoders for time-series windows: simple, convolutional, denoising, LSTM, stacked, and variational variants, in both encode and encode-decode forms.
- [classification](classification/README.md) — Classification with classic algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP), covering training, prediction, and evaluation flows.
- [feature-selection](feature-selection/README.md) — Feature selection via FSS (wrapper), Information Gain (filter), Lasso (embedded), and Relief (filter) to identify relevant variables.
- [sampling](sampling/README.md) — Class balancing via oversampling and undersampling to address imbalance in classification tasks.
- [timeseries](timeseries/README.md) — Time series: encoding (p->k) and reconstruction (k->p) with autoencoders to assess reconstruction error and extract compact representations.
