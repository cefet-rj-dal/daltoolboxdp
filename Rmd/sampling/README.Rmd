# Class Imbalance — Examples

Examples of techniques to handle class imbalance. Each link includes a short description.

- [bal_oversampling.Rmd](bal_oversampling.Rmd) — Oversampling: increases the minority class by replicating samples until the desired balance is reached.
- [bal_subsampling.Rmd](bal_subsampling.Rmd) — Subsampling (undersampling): reduces the majority class by removing samples to balance the classes.
